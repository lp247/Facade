Hi, my name is Peter Lehnhardt.

I am a software developer located in Frankfurt, Germany. I work within the Typescript/Javascript ecosystem of website design. I work at SAP where I help create the future of cloud business analytics. I spend my free time building things and experimenting with new technologies.

I am a software developer because I aspire to channel my mind, creativity and work into building things that have a positive impact on the world and its people. I admire its great potential to automate tasks and free people from hard and mundane work; I admire its ability to heavily cut errors in work and processes; I admire its potential to solve complex problems in the world indefinitely.

Software development for me is foremost a means to achieve those goals. But I appreciate no less the beauty of proper development itself as it acts firstly as an expression of engineering art and secondly directly translates into a beautiful product.

If you are interested in what I do or if you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me on one of my social accounts!

See you! Peter
