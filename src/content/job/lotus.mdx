Lotus was an IT service provider for the parent company group Hailo. Main task of the work was development of internal management software. This software was developed with Javascript and React in an agile environment with clearly defined product iterations in sprints. Development tasks were equally distributed between the team members.

Additionally, in the second part of my employment at Lotus, I was responsible for the development of a mobile app written in Typescript and React-Native. It also required a native module for communication with external devices via wifi which I did write using Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS.

While working at Lotus I could broaden my Javascript and React skills a lot, extending my knowledge I gained since learning React on my own. Additionally, while working on a Typescript project, I learned to know the power of Typescript, which I appreciate ever since. I also could gain a lot of knowledge in using React-Native and a little bit of knowledge in native development with Kotlin and Swift.
