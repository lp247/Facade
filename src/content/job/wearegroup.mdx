WeAreGroup was an IT service provider offering programming work force for external customers. While being employed at WeAreGroup I was working on two customer projects:

-   Development of a frontend of an internal management systems written in Javascript and React. Specifically, I was mainly designing, creating and testing new and refactoring old components to be used inside the page. The components I created included very complex ones, e.g. an Asana-like drag-and-drop dashboard for kanban lanes or a matrix multi-date selector.
-   Refactoring of a PHP codebase

Additionally, I have created a new plugin for the company's content management system strap to sync new job applications to an Asana project.

While working at WeAreGroup I could deepen my Javascript and React skills a lot and there was not much left to learn in React. My experience in working with PHP strenghened a lot as well.
