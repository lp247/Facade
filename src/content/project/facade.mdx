summary: I wanted to have my own website for quite some time but actually never managed to create one. Maybe also due to limited time but I guess the main reason was that there was actually no interesting framework to use. Or at least I did not know any. This changed when I heard from Astro - a framework for server-side rendering of websites where you can use all the frontend frameworks you like. As soon as heard about it - probably from hacker news - I started working with it and creating my own website. I also use TailwindCSS for styling my website - another framework that I have heard about before but never had a chance to try. This website is intended to host any kind of information about me and what I do.

## What is the philosophy behind its design?

Its design is intended to be simple and minimalistic; its focus lies in the presentation of content. But I will adjust its style whenever I see a necessity to do so and therefore this website might change substantially over time.
