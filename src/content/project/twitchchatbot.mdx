In the past I did a little bit of programming on stream on Twitch.tv and the project I was working on was a chat bot for the Twitch chat. I got quite far and it was working quite well. You could define several commands to be used in the chat and the chat bot would then generate responses.

In the end the architecture of the chat bot was completely asynchronous. I also planned to introduce dynamic commands with user definable scripts to execute but I did also stop development at around that time and could not act on my plans.
