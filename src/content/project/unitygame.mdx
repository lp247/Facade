status: In Progress
summary: With some friends together I occasionally work on a cool game. It is developed with the Unity game engine and we create all the assets by ourselves. I will not showcase it for now as it still needs much development work, but hopefully, I will do it in the future. Also, I have to protect the idea, as everyone in the world would immediately copy it due to its absolutely mind-bogglingly brilliant idea ;)
