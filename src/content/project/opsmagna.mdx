name: Ops Magna
headline: A todo app with repeating tasks in any timely configuration
techs:
    - react
    - redux
github: https://github.com/tavnvs/Ops-Magna
year: 2018
status: Finished
summary: My first big project. A rather conventional todo app but with capabilities to define recurring tasks in a very flexible way, e.g. recurring every 5th last day in a month or every 20th day of a year. I created it with React and Redux which I got recommended to work on by a good friend who then finally dragged me into the world of coding. I spent a lot of time on it, developed it end-to-end on my own and in the end had a quite well-working end product. It was still only a website but I even used it for a short time on my phone for myself.

## The Beginning

I have always been interested in coding since I was a small child but never really got the chance to get deeper into it. That is until my good friend convinced me to have a look into website development with Javascript, React, and Redux. As I was also slightly unsatisfied with my studies at that time I gave it a try and learned website development on my own by first working on another project but quickly switching to this one. At first, it was extremely hard to learn all the necessary stuff. Webpack, ES5, ES6, ES2015, React with its early createElement-type-of syntax before JSX came into the world, all these kinds of things were extremely hard to fully understand. And I also needed a couple of attempts of starting again and again to really see progress in my understanding of all these things. But in the end, it paid off big time. Shortly after I got into the flow of developing with React & Co I added this skill to my Xing profile, which got me to my first student developer job. And after working on this project for a couple of months from the bottom up I could confidently say, that I gained a lot of deep knowledge about all the tooling, the Javascript language and the React framework.
