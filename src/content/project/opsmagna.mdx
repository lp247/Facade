My first bigger project. I used it to learn Javascript and React back when I was starting to dive into the programming world on my own.

It is a rather simple todo app, but it got so far as to provide functionality to define repeatable tasks in any timely configuration, e.g. you could define tasks repeating every third last day of every month. I did never use it much but it was actually in a decent usable state.

This project also taught me first hand the usefulness of good tests. The logic for the repeating logic was quite complex and there was no chance to survive without tests. In the end, a comprehensive set of unit tests brought me good confidence in my code.
