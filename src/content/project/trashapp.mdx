summary: At Lotus I developed a massively disruptive new user experience for managing kitchen-built-in garbage cans. This new app allowed users to keep their hands from their disgusting garbage can at all times. Just a single touch on a button on the mobile phone would trigger the garbage can to open. One step further to live a happy life where you can manage everything from your phone without getting your hands dirty by touching stuff! Gross! Well, you still have to bring out the trash yourself, but psssst! Nobody has to know that!
