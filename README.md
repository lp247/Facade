# Facade

Welcome to my personal page.

This website is built with the [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and hosted at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

I created this website primarily as a hub for information about what I do. Secondarily, I also wanted to gain a lot more skills in website building and like to learn new technologies. Astro seems to be a strong candidate for productive website generation and therefore I went ahead and created my personal website with it.

You can find a lot more information about me and my work - including information about this website itself - after visiting the hosted version at [lp247.dev](https://lp247.dev).

If you have any feedback or anything else to say, don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
